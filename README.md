# dic2
The focus on this project is to provide a means to generate character distributions
from a given file. Afterwards, compression operations can be performed on the distribution. 
Huffman compression will be added and performed on both a randomly generated distribution
as well as distributions generated from files.

Written in C.

## Compiling
Assuming you have CMake installed, create a directory called "build"
in the project root. Then, just cd into build and run "cmake .."
and then "make" from command line.
